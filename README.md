# Pointless Wordle Solver

This is a very basic vanilla JS app to solve the Wordle puzzle game. The game is exceedingly boring if played with this script. Do not recommend. But it was fun procrastination. :) 

Word list from Donald Knuth's [list](https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Five_Letter_Words) of five letter words.

### To Do
##### back-end

- when we know a letter exists elsewhere AND it's already in known spot also (yellow e while also green e, meaning we know word must have another e in addition to the known one)
- when it shows letter as somewhere or known and also nowhere, cuz letter is only in there once (grey e and also green/yellow, so we know word has only the one e, not two)

##### front-end

- make responsive design better and less hacky
